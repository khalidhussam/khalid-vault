Q.1 The density of granite is 171 lb/ft3 (pound per cubic feet). What is granite's density in g/cm3?
Given that (1 lb = 453.6 g) and (1 ft3 = 28316.85 cm3).
 so basically the question is asking to convert from pound per cubic foot to grams per cubic cm. the rule for converting from pounds to grams is given in the question:
 $$1 lb=453.6g$$
so to calculate the mass we multiply 171 with 453.6:
$$171\times_{}453.6=77565.6$$
now that we have the mass we can calculate the volume which is basically 28316.85 cm3 for every 1 ft3:
$$1ft^3=28316.85cm^3$$
now that we have both the mass and the volume we can calculate the density by using this rule:
$$density=\frac{mass}{volume}$$
so:
$$\frac{77565.6}{28316.85}=2.739\text{g/cm3}$$
the density of granite in g/cm3 is 2.739.

Q.3: Which of the following is NOT true about acceleration?
a) Acceleration is a vector quantity.
b) Acceleration is measured in m/s2.
c) Acceleration is directed always in the same direction as velocity. 
d) Acceleration is the change in velocity per unit time
solution:
a) is true because acceleration has magnitude and direction which makes it a vector.
b)yes, acceleration is measured in (m/s^2)
c) not true because acceleration doesn't always have the same direction as velocity and might actually have the opposite direction as the velocity.
d)true because acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per time.

Q.4: Which of the following is NOT true about freely falling objects?
a) A freely falling object is moving under the effect of the force of gravity only.
b) All freely falling objects have the same acceleration regardless of their mass.
c) The acceleration of a freely falling object is directed always downward.
d) The acceleration of a freely falling object at the top point of its path is zero.
answer:
a) is true because it's freely falling so the only force is gravity.
b) is true because mass doesn't effect the acceleration of a freely falling object.
c) is true because a freely "falling" object is always pointing downwards.
d) is not true because when the object velocity at the top equals to zero that doesn't effect the acceleration of that object because acceleration is the average change in velocity.

Q.5: A stone is dropped from rest from a location 60 m above ground. Assuming no air resistance, what is the height of the stone above ground at the moment when it is moving at a speed of 29 m/s?
solution is:
