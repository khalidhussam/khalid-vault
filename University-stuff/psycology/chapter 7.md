**in this course we will talk about:**
-basic learning concepts and learning conditioning
-operant conditioning
-biology, cognition and learning

**What is learning?**
it's a process of learning new information and behaviors through experience.

**how do we learn?**
*-associative learning:* when two things occur at the same time, also called (respondent behavior)

*-through consequences:* association between a response and a consequence,  also called(operant behavior).

-*through acquisition:* is when the object connects a physical state to a mental information, bell, also called (cognitive learning).

**more on respondent behavior**
*for example:* when thunder and the sound of thunder occur at the same time you would be startled but when a thunder comes the second time you wouldn't be startled because you anticipated it,
**more on operant behavior**
*for example:* when a kid asks his parents politely for a cookie and they give him that cookie he will associate being polite means positive consequences, actions followed by rewards increase and actions followed by a punishment decrease

**more on cognitive learning**
 *for example:* Pavlov in his experience ran a bell every time he gave his dog food and when he ran the bell without giving the dog food he started to produce saliva which means that he associated the sound of the bell with producing saliva. *extension:* diminishing of a conditioned response, happens when the unconditioned stimulus (US) stops following the  conditioned stimulus (CS).
