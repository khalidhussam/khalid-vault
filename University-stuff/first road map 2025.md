# Java Learning Roadmap

## Strengthen Fundamentals & OOP Basics

### Goals

- Review Java syntax, control structures, and basic programming constructs.
- Deepen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### Action Items

- **Tutorials & Exercises:** Work through an online Java tutorial or a beginner’s book (e.g., *Head First Java*). Focus on:
  - Variables, loops, conditionals, functions.
- **Practice OOP:** Create simple classes and objects.
  - Experiment with constructors, methods, and encapsulation.
- **Mini-Project:** Build a small command-line application.
  - Example: A calculator or a text-based game.

### Uni Alignment

- Fundamentals will help with early software engineering courses.

## : Dive Deeper into OOP & Basic Data Handling

### Goals

- Solidify OOP concepts.
- Begin handling data with Java’s built-in collections.

### Action Items

- **Advanced OOP:** Explore:
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces.
  - Refactor earlier projects to incorporate these principles.
- **Collections Overview:** Learn about:
  - Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, Sets.
- **Coding Challenges:** Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
- **Project:** Enhance a previous project by adding new features.

### Uni Alignment

- Builds programming proficiency for coursework.

## Data Structures & Algorithm Practice

### Goals

- Transition from theory to practice with data structures.
- Apply algorithmic thinking.

### Action Items

- **Implement Data Structures:**
  - Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees.
- **Algorithm Challenges:**
  - Sorting, searching, recursion.
- **Project:** Create a small application utilizing these structures.
  - Example: A simple inventory management system.
- **Resources:** Follow a structured course blending theory with coding challenges.

### Uni Alignment

- Reinforces concepts from CS courses and problem-solving skills for exams.

## Software Engineering Fundamentals & Project Design

### Goals

- Connect programming with software engineering practices.
- Learn design patterns, version control, and project planning.

### Action Items

- **Design Patterns:** Study basic patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer).
  - Apply them in refactoring previous projects.
- **Version Control:** Start using Git.
  - Experiment with branching, merging, and collaboration.
- **Project Work:** Plan and build a medium-scale project.
  - Example: A student management system.
- **Peer Collaboration:** Seek feedback from classmates or work in a small team.

### Uni Alignment

- Directly applicable to *SE201 (Introduction to Software Engineering)*.

## Advanced Java Features & Integration

### Goals

- Explore advanced Java topics.
- Learn about frameworks and libraries.

### Action Items

- **Collections & Generics:** Deepen understanding of Java’s Collections framework.
- **Concurrency & Exception Handling:**
  - Learn multithreading, synchronization, exception management.
- **Intro to Frameworks:** Explore JavaFX (GUI) or Spring Boot (web services).
- **Project Enhancement:** Improve the previous project using these new features.

### Uni Alignment

- Prepares for more advanced coursework and real-world applications.

---

## Capstone Project & Portfolio Development

### Goals

- Consolidate learning into a comprehensive project.
- Build a portfolio-ready application.

### Action Items

- **Capstone Project:** Develop a full-fledged Java application.
  - Options: Desktop app, web service, or physics simulator (aligning with coursework).
- **Documentation & Testing:**
  - Use unit tests (JUnit), Git for version control.
- **Portfolio Setup:**
  - Publish project on GitHub, write a summary explaining design decisions.
- **Reflect & Plan Ahead:** Identify areas for further study.

### Uni Alignment

- Demonstrates skills useful for coursework and career readiness.

## Additional Tips

- **Balance Your Time:** Aim for 3–4 hours of coding per week.
- **Apply Learning to Uni:** Use programming solutions in coursework (e.g., physics simulations).
- **Join Communities:** Engage in coding groups, online forums, or study groups.

By following this roadmap, you'll build a strong foundation in Java while reinforcing your university studies, leading to better grades and practical coding skills!
