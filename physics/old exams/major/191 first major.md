Q.1 The density of granite is 171 lb/ft3 (pound per cubic feet). What is granite's density in g/cm3?
Given that (1 lb = 453.6 g) and (1 ft3 = 28316.85 cm3).
 so basically the question is asking to convert from pound per cubic foot to grams per cubic cm. the rule for converting from pounds to grams is given in the question:
 $$1 lb=453.6g$$
so to calculate the mass we multiply 171 with 453.6:
$$171\times_{}453.6=77565.6$$
now that we have the mass we can calculate the volume which is basically 28316.85 cm3 for every 1 ft3:
$$1ft^3=28316.85cm^3$$
now that we have both the mass and the volume we can calculate the density by using this rule:
$$density=\frac{mass}{volume}$$
so:
$$\frac{77565.6}{28316.85}=2.739\text{g/cm3}$$
the density of granite in g/cm3 is 2.739.

Q.2: If a is acceleration, v is velocity, x is distance, and t is time, what should be the units of A and B
respectively if the equation Aa = v2t + (B/x) is dimensionally correct?
a which is acceleration is measured as:
$$\frac{m}{s^2}$$
and on the right hand side we have v which is velocity which is measured as:
