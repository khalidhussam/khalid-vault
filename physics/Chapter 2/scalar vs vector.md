scalars don't have directions, And are usually positive except for a few exceptions like temperature, here is a few examples:
- Mass
- Distance
- Speed
- temperature

Vectors on the other hand take direction into consideration, here are some examples:
- Displacement
- Velocity
- Acceleration

**Q1. if someone were to walk along the X axis 13m to the right, then switched directions and walked 4m to the left, what is the distance and the displacement in this situation? (represent everything in a quick picture)**
$$\text{Distance} = 13+4 =17 $$
$$\text{Displacement = 13 - 4 = 9}$$

**These are some general rules to understand the difference between speed and velocity:**
$$\text{Average Speed }= \frac{\text{Distance}}{Time}$$

$$\text{Average Velocity }= \frac{\text{Displacement}}{Time}$$
Why average? speed is the exact current distance being travelled each given moment of time while distance/time is the average of speed being travelled. 

some more general rules:
$$\bar{S}\neq \bar{V}$$
-------------------------------------------------------
$$S=|V|$$
--------------------------------------------
this is to calculate instant Velocity:
$$V=\lim_{ t \to 0 } \frac{\nabla x}{\nabla t} $$
-----------------------
But what if the speed is constant? this will make things a lot easier, to calculate the constant speed we can represent distance or displacement with D, it wouldn't matter it's the same formula:
$$D=VT$$$$D=ST$$
V represents Velocity and S represents Speed, so they both use the same formula and they're both much easier to calculate when it's constant
