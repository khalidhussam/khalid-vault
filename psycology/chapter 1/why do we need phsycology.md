humans tend to make these mistakes when they rely solely on their own common since:

-hindsight bias
	"i knew it", or saying after the fact that i've could've predicted it
-judgmental overconfidence
	people tend to think they know more than they do which leads them into mistakes.
-tendency to perceive patterns in random situations
	assume outcomes based on past experiences.
