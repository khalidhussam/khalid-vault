part A- We can analyze the graph to see where X is headed  near X=0 and see that when X approaches 0 from both sides Y=2 so the limit is 2

part B- the two sides of the limit of -3 are different to each where when x approaches -3 from the right the limit is 0 where when it approaches -3 from the left it's 2 so since the limits from the both sides don't match the limit of f(x) as x approaches -3 Does Not Exist(DNE)

part C- the function is not differentiable at x=-3 and at x=3 because it's not continuous, also it's not differentiable at x=0 and x = 1 because there is a sharp corner. 
So f(x) is not differentiable at these points x = {-3, 0, 1, 3}

**Q2- find the inverse of this function:**
**$$
f(x)=ln(e^{2x}-10)
$$**
we start by replacing f(x) with y then solve for x
$$
y=ln(e^{2x}-10)
$$
we apply e to both sides of the equation:
$$
e^y=e^{ln(e^{2x}-10)}
$$
e and ln on the right side cancel each other:
$$
e^y=e^{2x}-10
$$
-10 goes to the other side
$$
e^y+10=e^{2x}
$$
we apply ln to both sides to get rid of the e:
$$
\ln{(e^y+10)}=\ln{(e^{2x})}
$$
the ln and the e cancel each other so 2x goes down:
$$
\ln{(e^y+10)}=2x
$$
we divide both sides by 2:
$$
x=\frac{\ln{(e^y+10)}}{2}
$$
now we switch x and y to get the final answer:
$$
y=\frac{\ln{(e^x+10)}}{2}
$$
**Q3- use transformation to graph this function:**
$$
f(x)=-\sqrt{x}-3
$$
we start by graphing
$$
\sqrt{ x }
$$
it's something like this:![[Pasted image 20250210060007.png]]
it's generally good practice to graph by this order HSRV; where H stands for horizontal shift, S stands for Stretching, R stands for Reflection and finally V stands for Vertical shifting
now to graph:
$$ -\sqrt{ x }$$
we invert this over the x-axis so the graph will be something like this:![[Pasted image 20250210061115.png]]
and now we graph this function:
$$-\sqrt{ x }-3$$
to graph this function we shift the graph down by 3:![[Pasted image 20250210062344.png]]
and this is the final answer.
